    <h1>Paragraph</h1>
    <p id="first_para" >
        Narrative paragraphs are the building blocks you need to tell a story in English. This type of paragraph explains something that happened. Think about a time that a friend or family member came to you and said, “guess what!”. They probably then told you a story about something that happened to them. This is what a narrative paragraph is, but in written form.

    <p id="second_para"> I remember when I first arrived in the United States. 
        Even before the plane landed, 
        the little windows in the airplane revealed 
        snow and ice-covered houses and buildings. 
        As I walked off the plane, 
        cold air crept through the corrugated ramp 
        that led to the airport terminal. Some people 
        inside the airport were wearing big coats and hats, 
        which I had seen on television, but never up close. 
        I felt a little dizzy and needed to sit down, and then 
        my cell phone rang. It was my Aunt Sophia. She was waiting 
        for me outside in the passenger pick-up area, so I walked quickly 
        to the exit, forgetting all about my luggage. When the sliding 
        glass door opened to the outside, there was my aunt–a woman I hadn’t
         seen in over ten years–wearing a 
        parka and waving her arms frantically in my direction.
