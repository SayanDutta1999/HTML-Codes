<!--CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.What is CSS?
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, 
how elements are positioned and laid out, 
what background images or background colors are to be used, 
different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. 
So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs,
and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!

Using CSS
CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. 
However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, 
and easier for you to try it yourself.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title><b>My first html css </b></title>
<!--Internal CSS-->
<!--<style> 
body {background-color:powderblue;}
h1 {text-align:center;} 


</style> -- >
<! -- External CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>

    

<a style="color:blue;" style="font-size:70px;" title="this is my html" href="1st html page.html"> 
     click this link to go 1st html page.html <br> 
</a>
<a style="color:blue;" style="font-size:70px:" href="HTML color.html">
    click here to go HTML color.html
</a>

<h2><b>My first html css </b></h2>

<h2>Use the CSS border property for borders</h2>
<h2>Use the CSS padding property for space inside the border</h2>
<h1>Use the CSS margin property for space outside the border</h2>
<!--Inline CSS-->
<pre style="font-size:large;">
    Inline CSS
    An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.
    
    An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.
    
    The following example sets the text color of the {h1} element to blue, and the text color of the {p} element to red:</pre>
<h1 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>


<p style="color:red;">A red paragraph.</p> 

<!--Internal CSS-->

<pre style="font-size: large;">Internal CSS
    An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.
    
    An internal CSS is defined in the {head} section of an HTML page, within a {style} element.
    
    The following example sets the text color of ALL the {h1} elements (on that page) to blue, 
    and the text color of ALL the {p} elements to red. In addition, the page will be displayed with a "powderblue" background color: </pre>

<h1>A Blue Heading</h1>
<p>A red paragraph.</p>

<!-- External CSS -->

<pre style="font-size: large;">External CSS
    An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.
    
    To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page:</pre>
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>


</body>
</html>
